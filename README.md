# 🔥 Firewall Blocker Script (v1.0)

A no-nonsense PowerShell script to block or unblock all `.exe` files in a specified directory and its subdirectories using Windows Firewall rules. Built for sysadmins, pentesters, or power users who need control without the bloat.

> ⚠️ **Note:** I am not the original author of this script. I streamlined its execution and improved usability to make it faster and more accessible for practical use cases.
